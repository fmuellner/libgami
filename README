This is the README file for Libgami. Libgami is a GObject based library to 
connect to the Asterisk manager interface.

It integrates with the GLib main loop and uses the GObject signal system to 
notify about asterisk events, therefore integrating nicely with GLib and GTK+.

Although written mainly with the Linux platform in mind, it should compile on 
any UNIX platform supported by GLib. On Windows, it is known to work with the 
MinGW compiler.

While it aims to fully support the manager API, there is still some funcionality
missing. Refer to the missing section of the distributed API documentation.

It depends only on glib and gobject of at least version 2.16.

To rebuild the API documentation, you will need gtk-doc (note that gtk-doc is 
not optional if you plan to use "make dist" to build tarball).

To rebuild the included gobject-introspection metadata, you will need
gobject-introspection of at least version 0.6.2 as well.

For installation instructions, see the file 'INSTALL'.

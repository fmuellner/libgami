        Although the GAmi Library aims to fully support the Asterisk manager 
        API, some actions currently lack implementation (and will possibly 
        continue to do so). As of Asterisk 1.6.0.3, those are the unimplemented
        actions:

                <para>
                   The IAXnetstats action is another recent API addition, which
                   may return a completely empty packet. If the action changes
                   to something proper, it will probably be added.

                <para>
                    The IAXpeers action used to return the output of the CLI
                    command <command>iax2 show peers</command>. As of asterisk
                    1.6.0 it was changed to return a list of event packets
                    similar to the SIPpeers action. Unfortunately, it does not
                    return a ListCompleted event, which makes it difficult to
                    implement. It will be added some day, but while it remains
                    possible that the API changes to include said event, it
                    seems wise to wait.

                <para>
                    The ShowDialPlan action returns the dialplan as list of
                    events, one per extension. Unfortunately, it does not
                    include any event to indicate completion, so it is
                    currently difficult to add. It is not high-priority either,
                    as its use seems esotheric.

                <para>
                    The UpdateConfig action makes it possible to change 
                    configuration files using the manager API. It does not have 
                    a fixed set of parameters, so it is unclear if it will ever
                    be implemented. Its mainly used by asterisk-gui, so there
                    is no hurry implementing it.

2009-04-22  Florian Müllner <florian.muellner@gmail.com>

	* [r461]
	  Ported custom hooks to GHook. Refs #26.
	* [r460]
	  Add a proper error domain for failed actions and use it. Refs
	  #26.

2009-04-20  Florian Müllner <florian.muellner@gmail.com>

	* [r459]
	  Implemented alternative packet processing function using GHooks.
	  Refs #26.
	* [r458]
	  Added GHook functions for setting results. Refs #26.

2009-04-15  Florian Müllner <florian.muellner@gmail.com>

	* [r457]
	  Started porting the private API to use GHooks instead of custom
	  hooks. Refs #26.
	* [r456]
	  Moved some more functions to gami-manager-private
	* [r455]
	  Updated build system to depend on GIO as well. Refs #26.

2009-04-07  Florian Müllner <florian.muellner@gmail.com>

	* [r454]
	  moved some code into functions accessible from internal headers
	  to reimplement the !UserEvent action with the new API. Refs #26.
	* [r453]
	  Another huge changeset:
	  * changed API to use GIO for asynchronous functions - the
	  external API should be fine now (refs #26)
	  * started to migrate internal API to its own files - more
	  restructuring will be needed
	  * many changes as well to the internal API - this process is yet
	  unfinished, more changes are to be expected there (without
	  effecting the external API though)

2009-04-01  Florian Müllner <florian.muellner@gmail.com>

	* [r375]
	  Updated documentation

2009-03-04  Florian Müllner <florian.muellner@gmail.com>

	* [r358]
	  Reverting the last revision and taking a different approach to
	  fixing the broken asynchronous behaviour when called from
	  callbacks: packets are stored in a buffer, which is processed
	  from the main loop and not the dispatch function. Fixes #25.

2009-03-03  Florian Müllner <florian.muellner@gmail.com>

	* [r357]
	  Allow socket to be polled recursively, so that actions can be
	  called synchronously from signal handlers. This refs #25, but
	  there may be more elegant alternatives.

	  and process received packets afterwards. Refs #24, fixes #24.
	* [r351]
	  Updated trunk version

	  Fixes #10.
	* [r337]
	  Updated autogen.sh to check for AC_PROG_LIBTOOL instead of
	  AM_PROG_LIBTOOL

2009-02-26  Florian Müllner <florian.muellner@gmail.com>

	* [r336]
	  Documentation update. Fixes #19.
	* [r335]
	  I consulted the documentation again, GIOCondition '''is''' a
	  flag, so the last modification was not the correct solution after
	  all - it did not work at all in Windows.
	  
	  Reverted to reading all data at once and fixed the warning. First
	  tests indicate that it works pretty well on Linux, while on
	  Windows I noticed some strange problems with the watch callback
	  being disconnected without apparent reason. Refs #21.
	* [r334]
	  Reverted the last modification, so dispatch_ami does once again
	  process a single line read from the socket. The dispatching
	  problems seem to have been caused by improper use of
	  g_io_channel_add_watch - the condition parameter was treated as
	  flag value, which it is not. Changing the code to register
	  dispatch_ami once for every condition monitored seems to fix the
	  problem. Refs #21.
	  
	  I will do a quick test on Windows and if the fix works there as
	  well, I will close bug #21.
	* [r333]
	  Keep reading from socket while data is available. This fixes does
	  fix indeed fixed the dispatching problems, the only drawback
	  being a warning on socket close (after logoff action). Refs #21.

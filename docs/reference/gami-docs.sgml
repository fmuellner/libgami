    <title>GAmi Overview</title>
    <para>
	    Gami is a GObject based library to integrate the
	    <ulink url="http://asterisk.org">Asterisk</ulink> manager interface
	    (AMI) with GLib and Gtk+. It should work on any UNIX-like platform
	    supported by GLib, and even Windows, though the latter has not been
	    tested. Gami is released under the GNU General Public License
	    (GNU GPL).
    </para>
    <para>
	    The library aims to fully support the Asterisk Manager API, 
	    indepentantly from the API version used. Actions which differ in 
	    syntax between different versions of Asterisk are handled 
	    transparently, though no effort is taken to ensure an action is 
	    actually supported by the asterisk version in use.

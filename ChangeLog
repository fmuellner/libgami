	* [r358] src/gami-manager.c:
	  Reverting the last revision and taking a different approach to
	  fixing the broken asynchronous behaviour when called from
	  callbacks: packets are stored in a buffer, which is processed
	  from the main loop and not the dispatch function. Fixes #25.

2009-03-03  Florian Müllner <florian.muellner@gmail.com>

	* [r357] src/gami-manager.c:
	  Allow socket to be polled recursively, so that actions can be
	  called synchronously from signal handlers. This refs #25, but
	  there may be more elegant alternatives.
	* [r354] src/gami-manager.c:
	  Change in internal function dispatch_ami: read all network data
	  and process received packets afterwards. Refs #24, fixes #24.
	* [r351] ChangeLog, configure.ac:
	  Updated trunk version

2009-03-02  Florian Müllner <florian.muellner@gmail.com>

	* [r344] ChangeLog, configure.ac, src/Makefile.am:
	  Some build system cleanup
	* [r343] docs/reference/building.sgml,
	  docs/reference/compiling.sgml:
	  Documentation update

2009-02-27  Florian Müllner <florian.muellner@gmail.com>

	* [r339] src/gami-manager.c:
	  Do not use mktemp() when generating a random ActionID on Windows.
	  Fixes #10.
	* [r337] autogen.sh:
	  Updated autogen.sh to check for AC_PROG_LIBTOOL instead of
	  AM_PROG_LIBTOOL

	* [r336] AUTHORS, ChangeLog, Makefile.am, configure.ac,
	  docs/reference/Makefile.am, docs/reference/example.sgml,
	  docs/reference/libgami-docs.sgml:
	  Documentation update. Fixes #19.
	* [r335] src/gami-manager.c:
	  I consulted the documentation again, GIOCondition '''is''' a
	  flag, so the last modification was not the correct solution after
	  all - it did not work at all in Windows.
	  
	  Reverted to reading all data at once and fixed the warning. First
	  tests indicate that it works pretty well on Linux, while on
	  Windows I noticed some strange problems with the watch callback
	  being disconnected without apparent reason. Refs #21.
	* [r334] src/gami-manager.c:
	  Reverted the last modification, so dispatch_ami does once again
	  process a single line read from the socket. The dispatching
	  problems seem to have been caused by improper use of
	  g_io_channel_add_watch - the condition parameter was treated as
	  flag value, which it is not. Changing the code to register
	  dispatch_ami once for every condition monitored seems to fix the
	  problem. Refs #21.
	  
	  I will do a quick test on Windows and if the fix works there as
	  well, I will close bug #21.
	* [r333] src/gami-manager.c:
	  Keep reading from socket while data is available. This fixes does
	  fix indeed fixed the dispatching problems, the only drawback
	  being a warning on socket close (after logoff action). Refs #21.

2009-02-25  Florian Müllner <florian.muellner@gmail.com>

	* [r332] src/Makefile.am:
	  Enable G_DISABLE_DEPRECATED compile flag to be future-proof
	* [r331] src/gami-manager.c:
	  Workaround for cases where ActionID header is ignored. Refs #23,
	  fixes #23.
	* [r330] src/gami-manager.c:
	  * Rewrite of networking code. Refs #21
	  * Allow more than one pending action. Refs #10
	  
	  Fixes #21 and fixes #10.

2009-02-24  Florian Müllner <florian.muellner@gmail.com>

	* [r329] src/gami-manager.c:

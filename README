This is the README file for Libgami. Libgami is a GObject based library to 
connect to the Asterisk manager interface.

It integrates with the GLib main loop and uses the GObject signal system to 
notify about asterisk events, therefore integrating nicely with GLib and GTK+.

Although written mainly with the Linux platform in mind, it should compile on 
any UNIX platform supported by GLib. On Windows, it is known to work with the 
MinGW compiler.

While it aims to fully support the manager API, there is still some funcionality
missing. Refer to the missing section of the distributed API documentation.

For installation instructions, see the file 'INSTALL'.

	<title>Building the Library on UNIX</title>
	<para>
		On UNIX, GAmi uses the standard GNU build system, using
		<application>autoconf</application> for package configuration 
		and resolving portability issues,
		<application>automake</application> for building makefiles that
		comply with the GNU Coding Standards, and
		<application>libtool</application> for building shared libraries
		on multiple platforms. The normal sequence for compiling and 
		installing the GAmi Library is thus:

		<literallayout>
			<userinput>./configure</userinput>
			<userinput>make</userinput>
			<userinput>make install</userinput>
		</literallayout>
	</para>

	<para>
		The standard options provided by
		<application>GNU autoconf</application> may be passed to the 
		<command>configure</command> script. Please see the 
		<application>autoconf</application> documentation or run
		<command>./configure --help</command> for information about the
		standard options.
	</para>
	<para>
		In addition to the standard options, the
		<command>configure</command> script supports these additional
		arguments:

		<cmdsynopsis>
			<command>configure</command>
			<group>
				<arg>--enable-gtk-doc=[auto|yes|no]</arg>
			</group>
		</cmdsynopsis>
	</para>

	<formalpara>
		<title><systemitem>--enable-gtk-doc</systemitem></title>

		<para>
			Build API documentation for GAmi. Note that you must 
			have <application>gtk-doc</application> installed on 
			your system for this option to work
		</para>

	<para>
		Before you can compile the GAmi library, you need to have 
		other tools and libraries installed on your system. The two 
		tools needed during the build process (as differentiated from 
		the tools used in when creating GAmi mentioned above such as 
		<application>autoconf</application>) are
		<command>pkg-config</command> and make.
	</para>
	<para>
		GAmi depends on two other libraries, GLib and GObject. To 
		successfully build GAmi, make sure those are installed 
		including their corresponding header files.
